## References

The $S_8$ calculation is done following Appendix A from [Euclid preparation XXVIII. Forecasts for ten different higher-order weak lensing statistics](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/07/aa46017-23/aa46017-23.html#R20).

The marginalisation procedure follows Section 3.1 in [Coe 2009](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.4123.pdf). (but it says the opposite in the marginalisation section?)
